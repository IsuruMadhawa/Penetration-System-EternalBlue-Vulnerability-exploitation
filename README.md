# Penetration-System-EternalBlue-Vulnerability-exploitation
This paper deals with how to exploit the eternal  blue vulnerability in Microsoft Windows XP, Windows 7,  Windows 10, server 2008 r2 (*all sp's), and server  2016.EternalBlue is a cyber-threat actor exploit that uses  specially crafted packets to remotely execute arbitrary code  and get network access.. It takes advantage of a flaw in Microsoft's Server Message Block (SMB) version 1 (SMBv1) protocol, which is a network file sharing mechanism that allows users to access files on a distant server. This vulnerability could allow cybercriminals to take control of the entire network and all devices connected to it. Because of Eternal Blueâ€™s capacity to hack networks, if one device is infected with malware (WannaCry) using Eternal Blue, the entire network is in danger. What's more the attackers still keep attacks on the networks that run windows 10, 7, 8, or 2008, 2016 servers
